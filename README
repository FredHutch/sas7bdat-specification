This repository contains a reverse-engineered specification of the SAS7BDAT file format.

The specification was written by Dr. Matthew Shotwell and contributed to by Dr. Clint Cummings and others.

David Costanzo forked Dr. Shotwell's repository to be able to contribute to the specification.

The repository has also been restructured to make the specification more prominent.
The R code has been removed, which also means removing the code that downloads sample data.

Style Guide

In order to allow contributions from multiple people but still have a specification that reads
well, arbitrary choices must all be made the same way.

Hexadecimal numbers must be represented with an x prefix.  For example, "x3F".
