  # For tables whose headers are: | Offset | Length | Confidence | Description |
  # Sometimes the description is long and the table layout algorithm gives it
  # so much space that it gives a single character to Offset, Length, and Confidence.
  # This leads to a hard-to-read table.  This style sets an explicit width for the
  # first three columns

  # The Page Type Table has long column headers on the final two columns.
  # Without a style, the long column headers causes the column to take up so much space
  # that the first three columns are only given one character width.
